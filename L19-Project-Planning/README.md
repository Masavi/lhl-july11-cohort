### 1. What is a Project?
---

By definition, we describe a project as a planned set of tasks or undertaking. For your execution to be called a project, there needs to be some sort of requirement(s), and a plan in order to reach that desired outcome.

### 2. Types of Projects
---

There are all sorts of projects that may begin for any number of reasons. Consider the following:

* Personal / Portfolio Projects
* Contracts
* Corporate Assignment
* Volunteer

### 3. How to manage a Project
---

As long as you can reach the goal in within the time range you give yourself, you can manage a project however works best for you. You can also follow any of the already defined project methodologies. There are esentially two schools of thought: **traditional methodologies** and **agile methodologies**.

The Traditional approach is linear where all the phases of a process occur in a sequence. The Agile management gives prominence to teamwork, customer collaboration, and flexibility, working on many iterations instead of one big iteration.

#### Traditional methodologies

Traditional project management is an established methodology where projects are run in a sequential cycle: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure. The traditional project management approach emphasizes linear processes, documentation, upfront planning, and prioritization.

The most common example for this methodologies is the **Waterfall Methodology**

#### Agile methodologies

While Agile is a general approach used for software development, it relies heavily on teamwork, collaboration, timeboxing tasks, and the flexibility to respond to change as quickly as possible.

The agile manifesto has four essential values:

1. _More focus on individuals and interactions than processes and tools_
2. _Working software is more important than comprehensive documentation_
3. _Customer collaboration is more vital than negotiation_
4. _The process should respond to change rather than blindly following a plan_

Agile follows an iterative process where projects are divided into sprints of a shorter span. Unlike the traditional approach, less time is spent on upfront planning and prioritization as agile is more flexible in changes and specifications developments.

Examples of agile frameworks are: **Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming and Lean Development**.

### 4. The planning process
---

For any given programming project, regardless of which methodology you will be following, you have to tackle the analysis and design of the system first. You should always take into consideration the [Iron Triangle of project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle) (scope, time and cost for the given project), as this restraints will always guide what you will try to accomplish:

You can follow the next steps to achieve your goal: 

1. User Stories (Extract Nouns / Tables)
2. Wireframes (Consider use of Figma) [and Design]
3. Database (Identify Relationships)
4. ERD (Consider use of Draw.IO or Vizio)
5. Routes/Endpoints
6. Set up GitHub Together
7. Set up the Project Structure and Naming Conventions Together (Consider a Style-Guide for [JavaScript](https://airbnb.io/javascript/) / [Ruby](https://rubystyle.guide/) / [CSS](http://smacss.com/))
8. Decide on Workflow and Tasks (Consider use of [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), or [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira))
9. Communication ([Slack](https://slack.com/), E-Mail, [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com))

### 5. How to organize? + Tools
---

#### Have a Notebook

  Meeting, planning, research... these are all opportunities to make a note for later. You can use a regular notebook, pen and paper or just any note app in your phone or computer.

#### Use a Calendar
For meetings and core dates, it can be easy to double-book, miss something, or simply forget.

Try to use [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) (or a similar app), it can notify you on your phone, in your e-mail, etc. about scheduled meetings and any changes—get in the habit of checking it often!

#### Have a Schedule

  * Protect work-time and relaxation time
  * You need focus-hours in the day where interruptions can be minimized
  * Avoid social media and other distractions when working—sometimes it helps to have separate accounts on your OS, or two devices, one for work and one for leisure
  * Have set times for relaxation to ensure you are taking breaks—protect an evening with the family, etc.
  * Still having trouble focusing? Consider the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and use of [online timers](https://pomofocus.io/):
    1. Decide on a task
    2. Work on the task for ~25 minutes
    3. Take a break (5-10 minutes)
    4. Repeat the above 3 times
    5. Take a 20-30 minute break and return to step 1

#### Have a visual representation of the work to do

Try using any tool, application or real life objects that can help you to **always keep track of how much time you have left, and how much you have to accomplish in that time!**

Some tools to achieve this are:
1. Trello (or any other kanban app)
2. Miro (or any other general whiteboard to collaborate with your team)
3. [Github issues/labels/milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones): Github allows you to add issues as tasks to be accomplished, labels to have a better organization and finally you can assign these issues into a milestone that has a deadline defined.
